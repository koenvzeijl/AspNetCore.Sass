# AspNetCore.SassCompiler
[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/AspNetCore.SassCompiler.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.SassCompiler/)

Sass Compiler Library for .NET Core 3.x/5.x. without node.

## Installation
The installation of this package is quite simple, you can install this package using NuGet with the following command:

```shell
# Package Manager
PM> Install-Package AspNetCore.SassCompiler

# .NET CLI
dotnet add package AspNetCore.SassCompiler
```

## Configuration
After adding the package, the Sass styles from the SourceFolder (defaults to: Styles) will automatically be compiled into `.css` files in the TargetFolder (defaults to: wwwroot\css) on build. 
You can also adjust the default (`--style=compressed`) dart-sass Arguments in the appsettings.json.
To adjust any of the default configuration, please add one or more of the following settings to the appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "SassCompiler": {
    "SourceFolder": "Styles",
    "TargetFolder": "wwwroot\\css",
    "Arguments": "--style=compressed"
  }
}
```

## Sass watcher
To use the Sass watcher in your project, you must add the following code to your startup.cs:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) 
{
  
#if DEBUG
  services.AddSassCompiler();
#endif

}
```

I recommend adding the `#if DEBUG` statement to only use a watcher during debug mode.

## Examples
As an example, a configured version of a .NET 5.0 project is added in the /Samples folder. Please see the link below for quick access
